# MkDocs Material Starting Reference

This repo serves as an initial skeleton for integrating a Material for MkDocs site into CloudCannon's CMS.

It serves as a good example for build settings, high-level collection configuration, and snippet configuration.

It does not intend to be a usable template to start a new project from, but instead aims to be a helpful reference when configuring your own Material for MkDocs site on CloudCannon.
